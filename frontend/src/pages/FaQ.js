                    Depending on the intensity of the studies (how many classes
                    you take), it will take adults 8 to 12 weeks for a Tajweed
                    course. For Arabic, a course can last anywhere from 6 to 12
                    months. For children, it depends on their age, aptitude and
                    the support given by parents.

                    It would reflect poorly on a tutor's rating and review if
                    they were consistently late to lessons. Please do speak to

                    to make it to a scheduled lesson.

                    Qutor is a place for you to find students. We provide this

                    using Qutor’s classroom.

                  <p className="QuestionAnswer">
                    When a student hires you, a notification is shown on your
                    dashboard. You must be logged in to view this. You can see
                    the hire request in the “Received Invites” section on the
                    dashboard and can accept or reject the offer from there. We
                    also send you an email when you receive an invite but since
                    emails can sometimes end up in Junk folders, we encourage
                    you to check your Qutor dashboard by logging in regularly.

                    Your best chance of getting hired is if you create a great

                    certifications and qualifications and build a glowing
                    profile, which makes you stand out. Tip: Always ask your
                    students to rate and review you after your contract ends.
                    This helps to build your credibility with future students.
